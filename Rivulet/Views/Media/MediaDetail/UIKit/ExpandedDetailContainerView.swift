//
//  ExpandedDetailContainerView.swift
//  Rivulet
//
//  The below-fold detail surface for the UIKit preview carousel. Owned by
//  `PreviewCarouselViewController`, it sits above the collection view (which
//  holds the hero chrome) and below nothing else.
//
//  P2 lifecycle: this surface is active in BOTH carousel-stable and expanded
//  states. In carousel-stable it shows the episode PEEK for the centered card
//  (cascading in WITH the chrome/metadata, snapping out + re-cascading as you
//  page). Expanding just grows the hero above it; the peek stays put (its
//  bottom is already at the screen bottom in both states). Pressing Down then
//  scrolls the below-fold up, fading the hero and revealing the seasons header.
//
//  Layers it owns: the content translation, the header-reserve growth, the
//  episode-peek cascade, the seasons-header + small-logo crossfades. Layers it
//  does NOT own (the backdrop blur + hero chrome fade) live in the VC and are
//  driven from `onScrollProgress`.
//
//  Single clock (UIKIT_FOUNDATIONS §6): `scrollOffset` is the only scroll
//  timeline; `apply()` fans it out in one pass. The episode-peek cascade is a
//  separate, chrome-synced timeline (page changes, not scroll).
//
//  This session: TV route with INERT placeholders (episode card row + season
//  pill bar). Real cells + focus-driven scrolling come later. See
//  docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-01-uikit-expanded-detail-belowfold-design.md.
