//  PlayerProtocol-conforming adapter around AetherEngine.

//  Rivulet's only player: VOD and Live TV (one instance per grid slot).
//  Video must be displayed through `bind(view:)` / AetherVideoSurfaceView —
//  the engine attaches the active backend's layer itself (AVPlayerLayer on
//  the native path, AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer on the software path).
//  `currentAVPlayer` is still republished for non-render uses (mute
//  reapplication, item-level metadata observation).
//
//  Aether handles HDR10+ dynamic metadata preservation, HLG signaling,
//  EAC3+JOC Atmos stream-copy through MKV, and DV P5/P8.1 via dvh1+dvcC
//  in HLS-fMP4 sample entries. DV P7 plays as HDR10 base only. Routing
//  decisions live in ContentRouter; this adapter just bridges the engine
